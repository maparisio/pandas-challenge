Analyzing school and standardized test data

# Background

As the new Chief Data Scientist for this city's school district, I will be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

I hqave been assigned to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. To do this , I have been given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
